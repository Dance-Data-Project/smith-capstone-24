	abstract = {The purpose of our study is to broaden the investigation of nonprofit misconduct beyond financial fraud perpetrated by individual actors and to identify structural features that are more or less likely to be associated with actual misconduct. We utilize the Charity Navigator Advisory System and related press releases to identify 215 nonprofit organizations with confirmed or alleged misconduct. We also collect the IRS Form 990 information for 133 out of the 215 organizations with known misconduct and 150 organizations without known misconduct to compare their accountability structures. Our findings suggest that, while financial fraud committed by individual perpetrators against their organizations is the most frequently identified type of misconduct, a substantial number of other types of misbehaviors also commonly occur. Our comparison analysis indicates that organizations with known misconduct deviate significantly from scandal-free charities in several structural aspects.},

	abstract = {This review paper focuses on the gender disparity and causes of gender inequality and sheds light on the important studies on the topic. It also sheds light on the pay parity and performance literature. This review paper also sheds light on the definition, conceptualization, and measurement of employee performance. This review paper has also shown a number of studies that linked the relationship between pay fairness, organizational justice and employee performance. This review paper summarizes these findings and suggests areas where more inquiry is needed to resolve conflicting results. Around more than 50 papers have been studies out of which 12 studies and few blogs and articles are taken into consideration which provides enough evidence to justify that Gender Inequality, Pay Parity could affect Corporate Performance.},
