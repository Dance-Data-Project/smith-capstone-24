<p>This section demonstrates calculations and exploratory data visualizations on the balances and help us inquire about how endowment management affects these numbers. By investigating Section D, Part V of the 990 forms on Endowment funds. and variables 1a-g we can learn about the <strong>financial health</strong> and <strong>performance</strong> of the endowment fund including some of its sources of revenue, expense and impacts of the investment activities.</p>
<p>This will also produce insights on the endowment fund’s <strong>long-term sustainability</strong> and <strong>perpetuity</strong> which is especially meaningful for smaller endowment’s because they can learn from the successes of a larger endowment. It may also help them reevaluate their endowment management and how governance alters in the face economic downturns and market volatility.</p>
<p>How to interpret yearly endowment balance changes and what does it tell us about financial health?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A healthy endowment may have consecutive positive differences.</p></li>
<li><p>Having a larger end of year balance than their beginning of year balance prompts further investigations about whether these trends are attributed to larger sources of revenue such as contributions or investment earnings. Secondly, it would mean these revenue streams are larger than their expenses such as grants/scholarships, administrative expenses and other expenditures.</p></li>
<li><p>Measuring the endowment balances patterns over multiple fiscal years can inform long-term planning and decision-making. For example, the largest 10 endowment patterns can serve as an example for the smallest 10 endowments to make adjustments to their revenue and expense streams. For instance, this can appear as strategizing to increase investment earnings or contributions for the endowment’s continued growth and perpetuity.</p></li>

This will also produce insights on the endowment fund’s <strong>long-term sustainability</strong> and <strong>perpetuity</strong> which is especially meaningful for smaller endowment’s because they can learn from the successes of a larger endowment.

<p><strong>Table X</strong> prints a complete data frame for stakeholders to observe the beginning or year balances (<code>boy</code>), end of year balances (<code>eoy</code>), and change over fiscal years 2016-2022, (<code>differences</code>) for 173 companies. The differences were calculated by <code>eoy - boy</code>. There are a number of interactive features you can utilize to maximize your data exploration such as,</p>
<ul>
<li>By clicking the upward arrow for <code>differences</code> you can view the smallest balance changes, and conversely the downward arrow demonstrates the largest balance changes.</li>
<li>Within the search bar for <code>differences</code> you can manipulate the spectrum of values and customize whether you want to view negative or positive differences.</li>

<p><strong>Figure X</strong> depicts a line graph, emphasizing a visual representation of how the endowment balances fluctuate over time for each company. It highlights periods of growth, decline, or stability in each company’s financial position across fiscal years.</p>
<p><strong>Key Findings:</strong> In 2021, four of the five largest endowments experiences a sharp increase in their endowment balance differences where EOY is larger than BOY. These include New York City Ballet, Houston Ballet, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, and Boston Ballet. Similarly, in previous years, 2017, three of these companies also experienced a sharp increase in their differences. As of our latest fiscal year 2022, Boston Ballet is the only company to have a positive difference, prompting questions about whether their endowment management and revenue vs expense proportions varied from the other four endowments.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In 2021, four out of the five largest endowments saw significant increases in their endowment balances, with end-of-year (EOY) balances surpassing beginning-of-year (BOY) balances.</p></li>
<li><p>These include: New York City Ballet, Houston Ballet, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, and Boston Ballet.</p></li>
<li><p>A similar pattern was observed in 2017, where three of these companies also encountered notable increases in their balances.</p></li>
<li><p>These include: New York City Ballet, Houston Ballet, and Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater.</p></li>
<li><p>As of the latest fiscal year, 2023, Boston Ballet stands alone with a positive balance difference, raising questions about potential differences in their endowment management and revenue vs expenses.</p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="largest-5-distribution-of-differences">Largest 5, Distribution of Differences</h3>
<p>In <strong>Figure X</strong>, we observe similar trends to the line graph, but with a focus on the distribution, central tendency and spread of the values against competitors, as opposed to specifically the change over time. The median points of the top five ballet companies are within the same range, and a summary table can particularly distinguish what these values are. This indicates for all companies, half of the data is above and below this line and has a similar spread. Contrastingly, the size of the interquartile ranges and boxes differ starkly. In order from largest to smallest it goes as: New York City Ballet, San Francisco Ballet, Houston Ballet, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and Boston Ballet. Additionally by interpreting the shape of the box in relation to the medians, we notice that four companies are skewed while only one company has a proper median that equally splits the quartile into halves.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="smallest-5-endowment-balance-change-over-time">Smallest 5, Endowment Balance Change Over Time</h3>
<p><strong>Figure X</strong> presents the dynamic changes in the endowment balances across the bottom 5 ballet companies from our sample. We noticed that of the three companies, the trends of the Tallahassee Ballet and Ballet Quad Cities are closely alike through the fiscal years 2016- 2022, while the trends of the First State Ballet Theater experience a dip and spike from 2018- 2020. Moreover, the Canyon Concert Ballet data also starts in 2021 which can indicate there were no differences until this point, or the endowment started later than the others so it is missing data and has a different timeline from the 2016-2022 approximation. The y-axis range of dollars for the endowment balance differences is also 3x smaller for the smallest companies compared to the largest companies.</p>
<p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Fort Wayne Ballet and Grand Rapids Ballet experienced the most prominent activity in the endowment balance differences across the FY16-22.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>In particular, of the six years,&nbsp; they both experienced only two years of increasing differences and the other four years are characterized by declining differences. Indicating a long-term trend of a larger start of year balance than end of year balance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Like the patterns observed with the Largest 5 in 2017,&nbsp; three of the smallest 5&nbsp; companies also encountered notable increases in their balances.</p>
<ul>
<li>These include: Ballet Quad Cities, Eugene Ballet and New Mexico Ballet Company.</li>
</ul></li>

<p><strong>Figure X</strong> highlights periods of growth, decline, or stability in each company’s financial position across fiscal years. For example, the sizes of the interquartile ranges of boxes for all four endowments are small in comparison to the larger endowments which indicates their end of year balances did not significantly differ from the start of year balances. Further investigations could reveal if this was attributed to contributions, investment earnings or losses and sources of expenditure such as administrative expenses or grants and scholarships.</p>

<p>How does it evaluate the fund’s <u>financial health</u>: a healthy endowment may have a decreasing expense ratio because the firm may become more efficient at allocating expenses while an increase may indicate a financial strain or higher expenses on the firm.</p>
<p>How does it evaluate the fund’s <u>sustainability:</u> a consistent expense ratio may reveal a pattern into the endowment’s operations and spending habits; maintaining a ‘sustainable’ ratio is crucial to maintaining the endowment’s perpetuity and preserving their abilities to meet their objectives</p>

<p><code>Schedule_d_cleaned</code> contains 1061 observations and 10 variables. Three of the variables are characters: the organization name, fiscal year and EIN code; while seven of the variables are integers demonstrating different quantitative aspects of the endowment fund.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>organization_name</code> : Company names provided by DDP</p></li>
<li><p><code>ein</code> : unique nine-digit number assigned by the IRS to identity a business entity, 501(c) non-profits</p></li>
<li><p><code>fiscal_year</code> : a 12-month period that a non-profit organization uses for financial reporting and budgeting purposes</p></li>
<li><p><code>boy_balance</code> <strong>[1a]</strong>: beginning-of-year balances on the organization’s endowment funds for the current year; includes cumulative total of funds and assets held in the endowment from previous periods</p></li>
<li><p><code>contributions</code> <strong>[1b]</strong>: enter the amounts of contributions; includes donor gifts, grants, monetary donations and contributions in the form of assets or securities, as well as additional funds established by the organization’s governing board to function like an endowment</p></li>
<li><p><code>investment_earnings_or_losses</code> <strong>[1c]</strong>: represents income or losses generates from investing the endowments funds in financial markets (such as interest, dividends, capital gains or losses on investments), including both realized and unrealized amounts; for example reported net of transaction costs and earnings reported on a gross basis</p></li>
<li><p><code>grants_or_scholarships</code> <strong>[1d]</strong>: enter the amounts distributed for grants and scholarships; scholarships represent direct aid to individuals, they are distinguished from general programmatic aid referenced; funds disbursed to support specific programs, projects or individuals</p></li>
<li><p><code>other_expenditure</code> <strong>[1e]</strong>: encompasses any additional expenses incurred by the endowment fund during the fiscal year that are not classified as administrative expenses or grants/scholarships; may include fees for investment management, legal expenses, or other operational costs</p></li>
<li><p><code>administrative_expenses</code> <strong>[1f]</strong>: expenses can arise from either internal or third-party sources; relate to general operation and management such as salaries of administrative staff, office rent, utilities, and other overhead expenses</p></li>
<li><p><code>eoy_balance</code> <strong>[1g]</strong>: determined by adding investing earnings and subtracting investment losses to the beginning of year balance, after grants or scholarships have been awarded and other expenditures</p></li>
